This is the third repository we have had to make due to different issues we faced while trying to complete this assignment.

The other 2 repository links are as follows:

  - https://github.com/jayb25/mern-chat.git
 
  - https://github.com/Dilawer1/Webchat_Application.git

All previous commits can be found in these repositories.

**This is a *real-time web chat application we have created using a few technologies such as socket.io.**
