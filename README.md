# convo-connect

This is the third repository we have had to make due to different issues we faced while trying to complete this assignment.

The other 2 repository links are as follows:

  - https://github.com/jayb25/mern-chat.git
 
  - https://github.com/Dilawer1/Webchat_Application.git

All previous commits can be found in these repositories.

This is a *real-time web chat application we have created using a few technologies such as socket.io

## Technologies Used
__Client__: React JS

__Server__: Node JS, Express JS

__Database__: Mongo DB

*We have deployed the application and it can be accessed on the below URL:*

https://convo-connect.onrender.com/

*There is a bit of an issue with the deployed version of the application where the chats are not being updated on-screen when sent, and the screen needs to be refreshed to see the new message. However, this is not an issue if running the project locally.*

However, you can also run the project locally on your machine by following the below steps:

__Clone the repo__: https://github.com/Dilawer1/convo-connect.git

__Go into the project directory__: cd convo-connect 

__Install Dependencies__: npm install --force

__Go to the "frontend" folder__: cd frontend

__Install frontend dependencies__: npm install --force

__Install react-scripts__: npm install react-scripts --force

__Start the frontend__: npm start

__Go back to the root folder__: cd ..

__Start the backend__: npm start
