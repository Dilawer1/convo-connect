# convo-connect

This is the third repository we have had to make due to different issues we faced while trying to complete this assignment.

The other 2 repository links are as follows:

  - https://github.com/jayb25/mern-chat.git
 
  - https://github.com/Dilawer1/Webchat_Application.git

All previous commits can be found in these repositories.

This is a *real-time web chat application we have created using a few technologies such as socket.io

## Technologies Used
__Client__: React JS

__Server__: Node JS, Express JS

__Database__: Mongo DB

*We have deployed the application and it can be accessed on the below URL:*

https://convo-connect.onrender.com/

*There is a bit of an issue with the deployed version of the application where the chats are not being updated on-screen when sent, and the screen needs to be refreshed to see the new message, and therefore the notifications and the typing indicator do not show up. However, this is not an issue if running the project locally.*

However, you can also run the project locally on your machine by following the below steps:

__Clone the repo__: https://github.com/Dilawer1/convo-connect.git

__Go into the project directory__: cd convo-connect 

__Install Dependencies__: npm install --force

__Go to the "frontend" folder__: cd frontend

__Install frontend dependencies__: npm install --force

__Install react-scripts__: npm install react-scripts --force

__Start the frontend__: npm start

__Go back to the root folder__: cd ..

__Start the backend__: npm start
